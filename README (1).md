# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning




## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and prevention are key to reducing the mortality rate associated with heart disease. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters.
## Data Features

- Age: Age of the patient
- Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female)
- CP: Chest Pain type (0, 1, 2, 3)
- Trestbps: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- Chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- FBS: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- Restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (values 0, 1, 2)
- Thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Ca: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
- Thal: Thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect)
- Target: Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)
